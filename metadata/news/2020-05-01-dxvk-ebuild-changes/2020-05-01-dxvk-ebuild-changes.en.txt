For convenience sake I have removed the dxvk-config ebuilds.
The dxvk_config.dll can now be installed via the 'dxvk-config' useflag
that is available in the dxvk, and dxvk-mingw, ebuilds.

I have also added the 'custom-cflags' useflag which will apply a patch to allow
custom compiler flags.  This patch was default before, but I felt that making it a
useflag would be more convenient in case one would want to test if a compiler
flag is causing issues.
