The package dxvk has moved to dxvk-winelib,
and the package dxvk-mingw has moved to dxvk.

This is so that the mingw version can take higher
priority.

The installation directories have also changed.
'/usr/lib64/dxvk' will become '/usr/lib64/dxvk-winelib',
and '/usr/lib64/dxvk-mingw' will become '/usr/lib64/dxvk'.

To fix any symlinks in your wineprefixes just use
'dxvk-setup', or 'dxvk-winelib-setup' as usual.
