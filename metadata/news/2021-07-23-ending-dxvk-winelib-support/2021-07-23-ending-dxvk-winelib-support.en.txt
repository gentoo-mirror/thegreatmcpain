Since wine 6.6 has removed the ability to compile dxvk-winelib via the below commit,

and I don't think there's a need to use it anymore, I'm gonna stop maintaining the
app-emulation/dxvk-winelib ebuilds.

I will keep them in the overlay, and will even accept pull-requests for them.

If anybody needs help getting a mingw64 toolchain going for app-emulation/dxvk
